# Contributing to BitsPlease-solutions

Hello there. Thanks for taking time out to contribute to [BitsPlease-solutions](https://github.com/BitsPleaseMSI/BitsPlease-solutions)!

We are open to any kind of contributions towards: code refactoring, documentation, and solutions to new problems.

## Coding

Nothing fancy here, just:

1. Fork this repo

2. **Create a separate branch** for your changes

3.  **Make changes** in that branch

4. **Commit** your code.

5. **Push your branch** to remote.

6. **Submit a pull request**. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.

Please note - Create one individual pull request for each solution.

## Documenting

Code should be self-documented. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.
